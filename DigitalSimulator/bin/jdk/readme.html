<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<blockquote>
Thank you for downloading this release of the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 
The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is a development environment for building applications, 
applets, and components using the Java programming language.
<p>
A <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/ja/README.html">Japanese version 
of the README</a> is on the download web site.
<p>
The Java 2 SDK includes tools useful for developing and 
testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on 
the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command 
line. Except for the appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user
interface.

<a name="installation"><h2>Installation Instructions</h2></a>
<blockquote>
For installation instructions and system requirements for this 
release, see 
<blockquote>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/install.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/install.html</a>

<a name="docs"><h2>Java 2 SDK Documentation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The on-line <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/index.html">Java&nbsp;2 Platform Documentation</a> 
contains API specifications, feature descriptions, developer guides, 
reference pages for SDK tools and utilities, 
demos, and links to related information.  This documentation is also 
available in a download bundle which you can install on your machine.  
To obtain the documentation bundle, see the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs.html">download page</a> web site.
<p>
For API documentation, refer to the following sources:
	<ul>
<p><li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/index.html">The Java&nbsp;2 Platform API Specification</a>

This provides brief descriptions of the API with
an emphasis on specifications, not on code examples.

Java Class Libraries</a></i>, Second Edition, published by
Addison-Wesley Longman as part of 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/>The Java Series</a>.
These volumes include much more elaborate descriptions,
with definitions of terminology and examples for classes, interfaces 
and members in ten core packages.

<a name=relnotes><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>
<blockquote>

See the <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/relnotes.html>Release Notes</a> 
on the web site for additional  
information pertaining to this release. 
The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should check 
it occasionally for the latest information.

</blockquote>


<a name=compatibility><h2>Compatibility</h2></a>
<blockquote>

<p>
See <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/compatibility.html>
Compatibility with Previous Releases</a> on the Java Software web site 
for the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to 
support programs written for previous version of the Java platform. 
Although some 
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to 
current version with no reprogramming.  Any failure to do so is 
considered a bug, except for a small number of cases where compatibility 
was deliberately broken, as described on our compatibility web page. Some
compatibility-breaking changes were required to close potential
security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.

<a name=bugs><h2>Bug Reports and Feedback</h2>
<blockquote>

<a href=http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/>Bug Parade
Web Page</a> on the Java Developer Connection web site lets you search

<a name=contents><h2>Contents of the Java 2 SDK</h2></a>
<blockquote>
This section contains a general summary of the files and directories in
the Java&nbsp;2 SDK. For details on the files and directories, see
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/tools.html>SDK File Structure</a> portion of the J2SE documentation.

<dl>
    <dt><b>Development Tools</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>bin</code> subdirectory.) Tools and utilities 
        that will
	help you develop, execute, debug, and document programs written
	in the Java programming language. For further information, see
	the <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/tools.html>tool         documentation</a>.

    <p>
        <dt><b>Runtime Environment</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>jre</code> subdirectory.)
	An implementation of the Java 2 runtime environment for use by 
        the SDK. The runtime environment includes a Java
	virtual machine, class libraries, and other files that support 
        the execution of programs written in the
	Java programming language.
    <p>
        <dt><b>Additional Libraries</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>lib</code> subdirectory.) Additional class
	libraries and support files required by the development tools.
    <p>
        <dt><b>Demo Applets and Applications</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>demo</code> subdirectory.) Examples, with
	source code, of programming for the Java platform. These
	include examples that use Swing and other Java Foundation
	Classes, and the Java Platform Debugger Architecture.
    <p>
        <dt><b>C header Files</b>
	<dd>(In the <code>include</code> subdirectory.) Header
	files that support native-code programming using the
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jni/index.html">Java Native Interface</a>, the 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jpda/jvmdi-spec.html">Java Virtual Machine Debugger Interface</a>, the 
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jvmpi/index.html">Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface</a> and other 
        functionality of the Java 2 Platform.

    <p>
        <dt><b>Source Code</b>
	<dd>(In <code>src.jar</code> archive file.) Java programming 
        language source files for all classes that make up the Java&nbsp;2 
        core API
        (that is, sources files for the java.*, javax.* and org.omg.* 
        packages, but not for com.sun.* packages). 
        This source code is provided for informational purposes 
        only, to help developers learn and use the Java programming
        language. These files do not include platform-specific 
        implementation code and cannot be used to rebuild the 
        class libraries.  To extract these file, use this command:
<pre>
    jar xvf src.jar
</pre>

	<p>
	Do not modify core API source files. To extend the behavior of
	the core API, write subclasses of the core API classes.
	<p>
	For API documentation, refer to the following sources:
	<ul>
	    <p><li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/index.html">The Java Platform API Specification</a>.  

            This provides brief descriptions of the API with
            an emphasis on specifications, not on examples.

	    <p><li><i><a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/chanlee/>The
	    Java Class Libraries</a></i>, Second Edition, published by
	    Addison-Wesley Longman as part of 
	    <a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/>The Java Series</a>.
            These volumes include much more elaborate descriptions,
            with definitions of terminology and examples for practically 
            every class, interface and member.

<a name=jre>
<h2>The Java 2 Runtime Environment</h2></a>
<blockquote>
      You may not redistribute the Java 2 SDK with the applications 
      you develop. Instead, you may redistribute the Java 2 Runtime 
      Environment with your applications.

      The Java 2 Runtime Environment is available as a separately 
      downloadable product.  See the 
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/index.html">J2SE download web site</a>.
<p>
      The <b>Java 2 Runtime Environment</b> allows you to run applications  
      written in the Java programming language.  Like the Java 2 SDK, it 
      contains the 
      Java virtual machine, classes comprising the Java 2 Platform API, and 
      supporting files. Unlike the Java 2 SDK, it does not contain 
      development tools such as compilers and debuggers. 
      <p>
      You can freely redistribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
      with your application, according to the terms of the Runtime 
      Environment's license. Once you have developed your application using 
      the Java 2 SDK, you can ship it with the Runtime Environment so 
      your end-users will have a Java platform on which to run your 
      software.
      <p>
      Note that the Java 2 SDK has an internal implementation of 
      a Java runtime environment for its own use. This internal runtime 
      environment is contained in the SDK's <tt>jre</tt> directory. 
      Don't confuse the SDK's internal runtime environment with the 
      Java 2 Runtime Environment, which is a separately installable 
      product.
