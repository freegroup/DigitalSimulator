Introduction

     Thank you for downloading this release of the Java(TM) 2 SDK,
     Standard Edition. The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for
     building applications, applets, and components that can be
     deployed on the Java platform.

     The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
     testing programs written in the Java programming language and
     running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used
     from the command line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not
     provide a graphical user interface.
